# Markov Chain example in python

This is one of the classical and simplest example of a Monte Carlo simulation, the calculation of the area of a circle and the Pi number using Monte Carlo method.
The only assumption is that the area of a square is known.

We provide here the Markov chain Monte Carlo implementation.
The implementations are provided in pyhton3 scripts and Colab notebook.

The convergence folder provides an example of the performance of the algorithms as we increase the number of attemps.

The algorithm is an implementation of Algorithm 1.2 from the book by W Krauth "Statistical Mechanics Algorithms and Computations" Oxford University press (see book site [here](http://global.oup.com/booksites/content/9780198515364/)

The implementation provided here shows a plot illustrating the number of succesful attemps that launched over a circle for pedagogical purposes.
