# MonteCarlo-example and python programming
The first program is simply a test of numerical libraries and simple calculations
The second example is a simple program that plots a circle inside a unit square
The thirs example is a Monte Carlo calculation that obtains the area of a circle inside the unit square and computes Pi from that.
This is in fact one of the classical and simplest example of a Monte Carlo simulation
The algorithm is an implementation of Algorithm 1.1 from the book by W Krauth "Statistical Mechanics Algorithms and Computations" Oxford University press (see book site here http://global.oup.com/booksites/content/9780198515364/ )
For other similar implementations see for example https://gist.github.com/louismullie/3769218.
