# MonteCarlo-example and python programming

This is in fact one of the classical and simplest example of a Monte Carlo simulation, the calculation of the area of a circle and the Pi number using MonteCarlo method.
The only assumption is that the area of a square is known.

The algorithm is an implementation of Algorithm 1.1 from the book by W Krauth "Statistical Mechanics Algorithms and Computations" Oxford University press (see book site here http://global.oup.com/booksites/content/9780198515364/ )
For other similar implementations see for example https://gist.github.com/louismullie/3769218.

The implementation provided here shows a plot illustrating the number of succesful attemps that launched over a circle for pedagogical purposes.

We also provide a simple code that plots a circle inside a unit square (used for the graphical part of the code)
