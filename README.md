# Monte Carlo example and python programming

This is one of the classical and simplest example of a Monte Carlo simulation, the calculation of the area of a circle and the Pi number using Monte Carlo method.
The only assumption is that the area of a square is known.

We provide here two different algorithms for the same calculation: simple direct Monte Carlo and Markov chain Monte Carlo (Metropolis) 

The algorithms are an implementation of Algorithm 1.1 and 1.2 from the book by W Krauth "Statistical Mechanics Algorithms and Computations" Oxford University press (see book site here http://global.oup.com/booksites/content/9780198515364/ )

For other similar implementations see for example https://gist.github.com/louismullie/3769218 and many others (see also the animated gif in Wikipedia MonteCarlo article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method ).

The implementation provided here shows a plot illustrating the number of succesful attemps that launched over a circle for pedagogical purposes.

We also provide a simple code that plots a circle inside a unit square (used for the graphical part of the code)
