#Protein cavity example calculation
Example of use of the simple direct Monte Carlo algorithm used to determine $$\pi$$ for determination of a protein cavity.

The code implementing this calculation is McVol, available [here](https://bisb.uni-bayreuth.de/index.php?page=data/mcvol/mcvol) and decribed in this [reference](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00894-009-0541-y)
