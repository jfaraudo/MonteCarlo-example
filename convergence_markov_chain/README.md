# Analysis of convergence of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method towards Pi

The python program performs sequential simulations for increasing number of MC trials (adds more and more chains).

The data file corresponds to the output of a run of the program.

The plt files are gnuplot scripts to plot the data and the image files are exports of the gnuplot plot.
