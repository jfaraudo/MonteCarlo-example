# Monte Carlo example and python programming

Simple direct Monte Carlo calculation of the area of a circle and the Pi number as described [here](https://saco.csic.es/s/YcyKXyyDQ66N4KR).
The only assumption is that the area of a square is known.

The implementations are provided in pyhton3 scripts and notebooks.

The convergence folder provides an example of the performance of the algorithms as we increase the number of attemps.

For reference, see for example algorithm 1.1 from the book by W Krauth "Statistical Mechanics Algorithms and Computations" Oxford University press (see book site [here](http://global.oup.com/booksites/content/9780198515364/)
or exercise 5 pg. 145 of the book ["Doing Math with Python".](https://nostarch.com/doingmathwithpython)

For other similar implementations see for [example](https://gist.github.com/louismullie/3769218) , [Wikipedia MonteCarlo article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) and many others such this [video](https://youtu.be/VJTFfIqO4TU?si=EqeWqR_RGRtCf9dj).

The implementation provided here shows a plot illustrating the number of succesful attemps that launched over a circle for pedagogical purposes.

We also provide a simple code that plots a circle inside a unit square (used for the graphical part of the code)
